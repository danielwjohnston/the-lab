# Code Snippets

This directory contains useful code snippets, one-liners, and small utilities.

## Organization

Feel free to organize snippets by language, topic, or any other way that makes sense:
- Create subdirectories for different languages (e.g., `python/`, `javascript/`, `bash/`)
- Use descriptive filenames
- Add comments to explain what each snippet does

## Example Structure

```
snippets/
├── python/
│   ├── data_processing.py
│   └── web_scraping.py
├── javascript/
│   ├── dom_helpers.js
│   └── async_patterns.js
└── bash/
    └── system_utils.sh
```
