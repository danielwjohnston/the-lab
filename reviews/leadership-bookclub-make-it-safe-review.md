# Leadership Bookclub "Make It Safe" Slideshow â€“ Review & Improvement Suggestions

## Accessibility
- **Clarify the slide role semantics.** The `.slide` elements could expose clearer semantics (for example, `role="group"` with an `aria-roledescription="slide"` and `aria-labelledby` pointing at the primary heading). This helps assistive technology announce each slide meaningfully rather than as a generic region.
- **Prevent timer announcements from overwhelming screen reader users.** Consider using `aria-live="polite"` on a hidden status region and throttling announcements (e.g., every 30 seconds, last 10 seconds). The current 10 second cadence under a minute can become noisy.
- **Provide a manual focus target.** When `showSlide` sets focus to the active slide, ensure the slide itself is focusable by default (`tabindex="-1"`) and only add/remove that attribute on activation so focus does not jump to an element that has just been hidden.
- **Improve skip-link placement.** Moving the skip link so it is visually positioned near the top (e.g., using `transform` for off-screen placement) avoids potential overlap with the fixed header when it receives focus.

## Responsiveness & Layout
- **Add responsive typography.** The current headings (3.5em, 2.8em, etc.) overflow small screens. Introduce media queries or CSS clamp() to scale type so the presentation remains readable on phones and tablets.
- **Revisit fixed positioning of navigation controls.** With multiple fixed elements (header, slide counter, navigation, footer) the vertical real estate becomes cramped on short viewports. Allow the navigation bar to become static or use CSS Grid/Flexbox to stack controls when the viewport height is limited.
- **Avoid using large padding/margins on every slide.** The 40px padding and 120px top margin push content below the fold on laptops. Consider context-aware spacing (e.g., reduce margins when the persistent header is visible, or rely on CSS variables). 

## Maintainability
- **Centralize shared colors and spacing.** There are repeated literal values (`#e30613`, `#c20510`, padding numbers). Moving them to CSS custom properties improves consistency and makes brand updates faster.
- **Refactor duplicated structures.** Multiple `.story-box` and `.highlight` sections share identical markup. Converting repeated patterns into reusable components (or leveraging templating if this will be converted to a framework) reduces copy/paste changes.
- **Extract JavaScript configuration.** The `DURATIONS_SECONDS` array encodes labels via comments. Consider pairing durations with metadata (title, type) so the timer logic can adjust automatically (e.g., longer durations for discussion slides without relying on index alignment).

## Performance & Behavior
- **Guard against timer underflow.** When the timer reaches zero the interval stops, but `remainingTime` can dip below zero if `nextSlide()` takes longer. A simple `if (remainingTime <= 0) remainingTime = 0;` before updating the text keeps the UI accurate.
- **Pause auto-advance on manual navigation.** When presenters manually move backward/forward the timer instantly restarts for the new slide. Consider pausing auto-advance or at least resetting the countdown after a short delay so people can orient themselves.
- **Handle reduced-motion preference for the timer.** You already honor reduced motion in CSS; mirror that in JS by skipping the stroke animation updates if `prefers-reduced-motion` is detected.

## Content & Authoring Experience
- **Provide authoring notes in data attributes.** Embedding instructions (e.g., `data-duration`, `data-type="discussion"`) directly in the slide markup would let non-developers tweak pacing without editing JavaScript. The script can then read these attributes when initializing the timer.
- **Add keyboard shortcuts documentation.** Display a small help modal or tooltip describing the `Arrow` keys and the `A` shortcut for auto-advance so presenters discover them without reading the source.
