# Experiments

This directory is for experimental code, prototypes, and proof-of-concepts.

## What Goes Here

- Small projects and prototypes
- Testing new technologies or frameworks
- Algorithmic experiments
- Learning exercises
- Proof-of-concept implementations

## Organization

Create a separate directory for each experiment or prototype:

```
experiments/
├── neural-network-from-scratch/
├── web-component-experiment/
└── algorithm-visualization/
```

Each experiment can have its own README explaining what it does and what you learned.
